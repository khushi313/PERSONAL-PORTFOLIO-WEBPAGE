*DESIGNING A BASIC PORTFOLIO WEBSITE USING HTML AND CSS IS A GREAT WAY FOR DEVELOPERS TO SHOWCASE THEIR SKILLS AND PROJECTS. THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A SINGLE-PAGE, RESPONSIVE WEBSITE THAT LOOKS CLEAN AND WORKS WELL ON ALL DEVICES LIKE LAPTOPS, TABLETS, AND PHONES. THE WEBSITE IN THE IMAGE ABOVE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO*.

*THE WEBSITE STARTS WITH A HEADER SECTION THAT INCLUDES THE DEVELOPER’S NAME, “KHUSHI JAIN,” AND A SHORT TITLE LIKE “CREATIVE WEB DEVELOPER & SOFTWARE ENGINEER.” BELOW THE HEADER, THERE IS A NAVIGATION MENU WITH LINKS SUCH AS “ABOUT,” “PROJECTS,” AND “CONTACT.” CLICKING ON THESE LINKS WILL SCROLL THE PAGE TO THE CORRESPONDING SECTION, WHICH IS A COMMON FEATURE IN SINGLE-PAGE SITES*.

*THE “ABOUT ME” SECTION GIVES A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO THE DEVELOPER. THIS PARAGRAPH DESCRIBES WHO THEY ARE, THEIR PASSION FOR CODING, AND WHAT TECHNOLOGIES THEY LIKE TO USE. IT ALSO INCLUDES A QUOTE TO MAKE IT MORE PERSONAL. THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TELLS VISITORS WHO THE PERSON BEHIND THE PROJECTS IS*.

*NEXT COMES THE “PROJECTS” SECTION. HERE, THE DEVELOPER DISPLAYS MULTIPLE PROJECTS (IN THIS CASE, 5 PROJECTS). EACH PROJECT IS PRESENTED IN A BOX OR CARD FORMAT WITH A TITLE, A SHORT DESCRIPTION, AND A “VIEW PROJECT” BUTTON. THIS BUTTON CAN LINK TO THE LIVE PROJECT OR A GITHUB REPOSITORY. THE PROJECTS COVER DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORK SUCH AS E-COMMERCE WEBSITE, DATA DASHBOARD, TASK MANAGER APP, SOCIAL MEDIA APP, AND A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO. THIS HELPS SHOWCASE A RANGE OF SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES*.

*IN CONCLUSION, THIS BASIC PORTFOLIO WEBSITE IS A CLEAN, EASY-TO-BUILD PROJECT THAT EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD HAVE. IT SHOWS YOUR WORK, INTRODUCES WHO YOU ARE, AND MAKES IT EASY FOR OTHERS TO CONNECT WITH YOU. IT’S A GREAT STARTING POINT FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO ENTER THE WORLD OF WEB DEVELOPMENT*.
